/*
Get button events and signal a Cree Relay device.

The controller is connected via a Cree Connected Bulb zigbee radio, so it looks 
like a dimmable light bulb. An Arduino is reading the bulb output and interprets
the signals.

If the bulb is set to dim level ~10% then relay 1 is closed.
If the bulb is set to dim level ~20% then relay 2 is closed.
Otherwise, all relays are open.

In my use, the relays are physically wired to two Genie garage door openers, and operate
the doors just as if someone had pressed the wall buttons.
